# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 My overall approach was focusing first on identifying the core files (Game, Player, etc) and how they needed to interact. After that I implemented different features, seeing how things ran as I went along which helped keep the project manageable without having too much going on.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I figured out how to coordinate multiple classes interacting over time especially with events that were triggered by the player going somewhere specific.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
Possibly create a separate file for the enemy which could allow for different kinds of interactions.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
With unlimited time I would add multiple enemies, different floors to the house and maybe even levels to the game.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
I was not in class when feedback was given since I was sick.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
Spend more time upfront planning interactions between classes, especially combat and events since I wanted to do a lot more but couldn't because of limited time.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
